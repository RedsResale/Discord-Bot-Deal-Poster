Twitter to Discord using Webhooks

This is a new version of "TweetMonitor" tool that I shared few weeks ago. In this new program, the tweets are posted onto a discord server instead of desktop notifications.

Twitter UI has been recently updated. So this version is no longer active. Please download version4 branch.
Key Updates

    Instead of desktop notifications, tweets are send to discord server.
    Monitoring frequency is 1 sec. Feel free to customize it in the setInterval function of the code.
    Latency is around 2-3 secs.
    No need of access keys as this is implemented using web-scraping technique.
